# [Better Doctor](https://github.com/ryanglenferris/better-doctor.git)

#### Project for Epicodus focusing on API's using JavaScript. This application will use the [BetterDoctor](https://developer.betterdoctor.com/) API to help users find doctors in their area who can treat their medical issue.

By **Ryan G Ferris**

## DESCRIPTION

* A user should be able to enter a medical issue to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query.
* A user should be able to to enter a name to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query.
* If the query response includes any doctors, the following information should be included about each doctor: first name, last name, address, phone number, website and whether or not the doctor is accepting new patients (the API provides this data).
* If the API call results in an error (any message not a 200 OK), the application should return a notification that states what the error is.
* If the query response doesn't include any doctors (for instance, if no doctors meet the search criteria), the application should return a notification that states that no doctors meet the criteria. (This is not an error so it should be handled separately from any errors.)
